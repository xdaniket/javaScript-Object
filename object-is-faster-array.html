  /**
   * Q: Why Object is faster than Array ?
   *    Objects are faster than Array becoz in object it becomes very easy to get the any value**
   *    From object by using their key** name ,
   *
   *    But in case of Array if we have to get any value so we have to remember the index of
   *    that value, which is very difficult when we have a huge amount of data,
   *
   *    That's why Objects are mostly using instead of Array.
   *

  // Array :

  const array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 4, 2, 8, 11, 44, 2, 9, 0];
  console.log(array[9]); // return 11; Here we get the value bu their index number.

  // Object :

  const object = {
    fname: "Aniket",
    lname: "Thakur",
    age: 22,
    city: "Sehore",
    favMen: {
      cricket: "MS-dhoni",
      actor: "Yash",
    },
  };
  console.log(object.age); // return {age : 22}; Here we get the value bu their key name.
